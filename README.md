## Three components
Issuer: Issues and revokes credentials
Holder Wallet: Stores and presents credentials
Verifier: Validates credentials without contacting the issuer

## Steps to Run the Demo


Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/privacy-credential-system.git
cd privacy-credential-system

Create a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:
pip install cryptography flask click pytest


Running the System
1. Run the Automated Demo
For a quick demonstration of all features:
bashpython demo_script.py
This shows the complete workflow:

Creating an issuer and wallet
Issuing a credential
Creating a selective disclosure presentation
Verifying both the credential and presentation
Revoking the credential
Verifying after revocation (should fail)

2. Modifying the Demo
You can modify demo_script.py to test different scenarios:

Change the selective disclosure attributes
Create expired credentials
Test signature tampering
Add multiple credentials to a wallet
Create multiple issuers and holders

3. Using the CLI
For more interactive usage, use the command-line interface:
bash# Create an issuer
python run.py issuer create --name "California DMV"

# Create a wallet
python run.py wallet create --name "Alice Johnson"

# Issue a credential
python run.py issuer issue --issuer-id <ISSUER_ID> --holder-id <HOLDER_ID> \
    --type "driver_license" --attribute "name=Alice Johnson" \
    --attribute "DOB=1990-05-15" --expires 365

# List credentials in a wallet
python run.py wallet credentials --holder-id <HOLDER_ID>

# Create a presentation
python run.py wallet present --holder-id <HOLDER_ID> \
    --credential-id <CREDENTIAL_ID> --attribute "name" --attribute "DOB"

# Verify a credential
python run.py verifier verify --credential-id <CREDENTIAL_ID>

# Revoke a credential
python run.py issuer revoke --issuer-id <ISSUER_ID> \
    --credential-id <CREDENTIAL_ID>
Replace <ISSUER_ID>, <HOLDER_ID>, and <CREDENTIAL_ID> with the actual IDs displayed when creating those objects.



#### Current Output explanation (See Sample_Run.png)
The output you're seeing shows the successful execution of your privacy-preserving digital credential system demo! Let me explain what's happening at each step:

System Setup:

The script creates the necessary directories for storing credentials, wallets, and revocation lists.


Issuer Creation:

It creates an issuer named "California DMV" with a unique ID.


Wallet Creation:

It creates a wallet for "Alice Johnson" with its own unique ID.


Credential Issuance:

The California DMV issues a driver's license credential to Alice
The credential contains attributes like name, DOB, license class, state, and address
The credential receives a unique ID and is cryptographically signed by the issuer


Presentation Creation:

Alice creates a "presentation" of her credential that only reveals selected attributes (name and DOB)
This is a privacy-preserving feature that allows revealing only what's necessary
The presentation is saved to a JSON file


Credential Verification:

The full credential is verified successfully (✅ Valid)
The selective presentation is also verified successfully (✅ Valid)


Credential Revocation:

The DMV revokes Alice's credential
This updates the revocation list without contacting Alice


Post-Revocation Verification:

Both the full credential and the presentation now fail verification
The system correctly shows they're invalid because the credential was revoked
This demonstrates privacy-preserving revocation checking


Demo Completion:

The demo completes successfully, showing the core privacy-preserving features work
